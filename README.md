### Continuous Integration

To streamline collaboration, whenever a commit arrives to the main branch of this repository, continuous integration (CI)
will automatically build and deploy the game to the web. To further accelerate development and avoid caching issues,
[the CI distro pipeline](.github/workflows/ci_distro.yaml) ships to AWS S3 with CloudFront CDN.
