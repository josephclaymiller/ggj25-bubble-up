# Bubble Up!

[Play Bubble Up!](https://bubbleup.game.outright.io/)

Built in [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) for the [Global Game Jam 2025](https://globalgamejam.org/).

## Development

_To streamline collaboration, whenever a commit arrives to the main branch of this repository, continuous integration (CI)
will automatically build and deploy the game to the web. To further accelerate development and avoid caching issues,
[that CI pipeline](.github/workflows/ci_distro.yaml) ships to AWS S3 with CloudFront CDN._
